## Setup (packages and data)

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(here)
library(gt)
library(flextable)
library(readxl)

personal_data <- read_xlsx(
  here(
  "data", "personaldatahw3.xlsx"))

```

## Problem 1: Personal Data

### A: Data Summarizing

I could calculate the mean duration of bike rides (response variable) and compare the average times between the two directions (to Cambpell or to home). This is because I beleive that I bike faster toward Campbell hall compared to home, as I usually have a class I need to be on time for when going to campus, rather than simply biking home where there is usually no strict time that I need to arrive at.

### B: Visualization

```{r}

personal_data_clean <- personal_data |> 
  clean_names() #creating a new dataframe from personal_data and cleaning column names for ease of use

personal_data_summary <- personal_data_clean |> #creating a summary dataframe using the cleaned up data
  group_by(direction) |> #grouping by direction
  summarize( #using the summarize function 
    n = length(duration),  # count of data
    mean = mean(duration), # calculating the means of both groups
    standard_deviation = sd(duration), # calculating the standard deviations
    standard_error = standard_deviation/sqrt(n) #calculating standard error using the formula
  ) 

ggplot( data = personal_data_clean, #starting plot using the clean dataframe
        aes(
          x = direction, #setting x and y axes
          y = duration,
          color = direction #coloring/sorting by the two directions
        )) +
  geom_jitter( #adding a jitterplot as the first layer in order to show the underlying data
    height = 0, #setting no vertical jitter to preserve values
    width = 0.1, #reducing horizontal jitter for decluttering
    alpha = 0.4, #making points more transparent
    shape = 21 #making shapes of points open circles
  ) +
  geom_pointrange( #adding a second layer using geom_pointrange to add mean and SE bars
    data = personal_data_summary, #using the summary dataframe
    aes(
      x = direction, # putting direction (categorical variable) on the x axis
      y = mean, #y axis is the mean
      ymax = mean + standard_error, #adding error bars that are the standard error
      ymin = mean - standard_error
    ) ) +
  labs( #labeling the chart's x and y axis 
    x = "Direction", 
    y = "Duration (s)"
  ) +
  theme_classic() + #setting a theme
  scale_color_manual(values =
                     c(
                     "Campbell" = "darkorchid", #coloring datapoints differently
                     "Home" = "coral3")) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")


```

### C: Caption

**Figure 1: Average bike ride duration's are longer when biking to Home than to Campbell**

Open circles represent observations of bike ride duration in seconds (total n = 30), and filled circles represent mean. Colors represent direction (purple: Campbell, orange: Home). Bars represent standard error.

### D: Table presentation

```{r}

Table <- personal_data_summary |>  #creating the table as an object using summary data frame
  select(direction, mean) |> #selecting to only include direction and mean
  gt() |> #creating the table using gt 
  fmt_number(
columns = mean, #selecting columns to be edited
decimals = 1 ) |> #rounding to 1 decimal point
  cols_label( direction = "Direction", #altering names of columns/header to be capatialized and readable
                     mean = "Mean (s)") 

Table #displaying the table

```

## Problem 2: Affective visualization

### A: Describe in words what an affective visualization could look like for your personal data

My affective visual communication comparing the commute time towards campus and towards home could have curves representing a histogram of commute times, with collages of the scenes of the rides underneath them. I would have a central axis where each curve flipped (two sided x axis). One side of the axes would represent the bike times towards campus, with the reflection representing the bike times towards home. Underneath the curves, I would construct collages of UCSB and Isla Vista landmarks that I bike past on my commute. This could include the infamous roundabouts, Stroke tower, Pardall tunnel, the SRB, Kozy (my favorite IV cafe), the bluffs/ocean, and others. The ends of each side would come together with a photo of my home (perhaps using a generic IV apartment for privacy) and Campbell hall, both reflected exactly over the axis.

### B: Create a sketch (on paper) of your idea

### C: Draft of Visualization

### D: Artist Statement

For the content of the piece, I wanted to include the sites and scenery that many students (myself included) forget to appreciate on their daily commute to and from campus. I found inspiration from this work from my EEMB 3 class, where for one assignment we had to walk around campus and observe local plant biodiversity, which made me realize how much of my environment I let fade into the background of my college life.This newfound observancy, along with seeing various collages made by my roommate, inspired me to create a piece which combined these two things in order to remind us of the beauty of our surroundings, while also displaying data. The form of this work is a digital collage, and I am currently creating the project digitally using tools on my ipad such as canva, goodnotes, and procreate.  

## Problem 3: Statistical critique

### A: Revisit and Summarize

A two factor ANOVA statistical test was used. The response variable is alpha diversity (measured using the Shannon-Wiener index) and the predictor variables are treatment (burned or underburned) and time (pre-burn, postburn 1, post burn 2).

![Figure 5](figure5-193ds.png)

### B: Visual Clarity

The figure created by the authors clearly represented their data by including relevant statistics. The axes were clear by having their predictor variable of time since fire on the x axis, and their response variable of alpha diversity on the y axis. Moreover, by having different types of lines (solid and dashed) on the same chart to represent treatments (burned and unburned), readers can directly compare how different treatments impacted the alpha diversity. The figure also contained the mean alpha diversity and standard error at each point, however the underlying data was not displayed, making it difficult for readers to get a more detailed picture of the distribution of data points.

### C: Aesthetic Clarity

The creators of the figure did a good job in reducing its visual clutter. They were able to keep the data:ink ratio low by taking out gridlines, which allows for viewers to more clearly see the data points. Moreover, different species (such as lizards, mammals,etc) and fire types (burned and unburned) were clearly labeled without being overwhelming.

### D: Recommendations

There are a few changes to the figure that I would recommend to the authors. First, I would align the scales of the y axes between wildfires and prescribed burns. For example, between prescribed and wildfire burns in plants (3A and 3D), the top end of the y axes are 2.0 and 2.5 which can be misleading when attempting to make direct comparisons between the two types. By altering the scaling of alpha diversity to be consistent between both fire types, readers would be able to visually compare the impacts of wildfires and prescribed burns on alpha diversity without having to keep differences in y-axes in mind. Additionally, I would suggest adding some sort of key or legend for what the different line types (dashed and solid) represent. Currently this information is inconspicuously placed in a sentence in the figure caption, which makes it hard to initially understand what is being compared. By adding a larger, more obvious legend, readers would be able to scan the figure and understand the meaning of different lines without having to search in the figure caption.
