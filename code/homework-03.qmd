## Problem 3: Statistical critique

### A: Revisit and Summarize

A two factor ANOVA statistical test was used. The response variable is alpha diversity (measured using the Shannon-Wiener index) and the predictor variables are treatment (burned or underburned) and time (pre-burn, postburn 1, post burn 2).

### B: Visual Clarity

The figure created by the authors clearly represented their data by including relevant statistics. The axes were clear by having their predictor variable of time since fire on the x axis, and their response variable of alpha diversity on the y axis. Moreover, by having different types of lines (solid and dashed) on the same chart to represent treatments (burned and unburned), readers can directly compare how different treatments impacted the alpha diversity. The figure also contained the mean alpha diversity and standard error at each point, however the underlying data was not displayed, making it difficult for readers to get a more detailed picture of the distribution of data points.

### C: Aesthetic Clarity

The creators of the figure did a good job in reducing its visual clutter. They were able to keep the data:ink ratio low by taking out gridlines, which allows for viewers to more clearly see the data points. Moreover, different species (such as lizards, mammals,etc) and fire types (burned and unburned) were clearly labeled without being overwhelming.

### D: Recommendations

There are a few changes to the figure that I would recommend to the authors. First, I would align the scales of the y axes between wildfires and prescribed burns. For example, between prescribed and wildfire burns in plants (3A and 3D), the top end of the y axes are 2.0 and 2.5 which can be misleading when attempting to make direct comparisons between the two types. By altering the scaling of alpha diversity to be consistent between both fire types, readers would be able to visually compare the impacts of wildfires and prescribed burns on alpha diversity without having to keep differences in y-axes in mind. Additionally, I would suggest adding some sort of key or legend for what the different line types (dashed and solid) represent. Currently this information is inconspicuously placed in a sentence in the figure caption, which makes it hard to initially understand what is being compared. By adding a larger, more obvious legend, readers would be able to scan the figure and understand the meaning of different lines without having to search in the figure caption.
